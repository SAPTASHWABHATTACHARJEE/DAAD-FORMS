								I am Saptashwa Bhattacharjee, a 4th Year undergraduate student in the 
								Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering at the 
								Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur.
								<hr color=#434750>

								I have been fascinated by MOSFETs since I was introduced to it in my 2nd year of 
								undergraduate study and decided to dig deeper into it. I started by reading the book 
								<i>"Microelectronics"</i> and then continued exploring the next book in the series: <i>"Design of 
								Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits"</i> series by Behzad Razavi. Following this, I was thoroughly trained 
								in Cadence in the Advanced VLSI lab.	 
								<hr color=#434750>
								
								I was involved in the design of Radiation Hardened Cross-Coupled Quadrature VCO for the Indian Space
								Research Organization (ISRO) as an undergraduate research fellow. Following that, I did my internship 
								at the École de technologie supérieure - ÉTS Montréal on Ultra-wideband Wireless Integrated Circuits 
								for Ultra-low Power Communications where I focused on the design of Impulse Radio Ultra-Wideband non-coherent
								receivers. The frequency range of their operation was 3.1GHz to 10.6GHz.
