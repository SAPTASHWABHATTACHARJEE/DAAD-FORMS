								I am Saptashwa Bhattacharjee, a 3rd Year undergraduate student in the 
								Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering at the 
								Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur.
								<hr color=#434750>

								I have been fascinated by MOSFETs since I was introduced to it in my 2nd year of 
								undergraduate study and decided to dig deeper into it. I started by reading the book 
								<i>"Microelectronics"</i> and then continued exploring the next book in the series: <i>"Design of 
								Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits"</i> series by Behzad Razavi. Following this, I was thoroughly trained 
								in Cadence in the Advanced VLSI lab.	 
								<hr color=#434750>
								
								My area of interest is Mixed Signal IC Design, Analog and Digital Electronic Circuits with a particular focus 
								on oscillators, PLL, and making designs that are radiation hardened for space applications.

								A few days back, an institute lecture organized by the Office of International Relations hosted Professor T. Venkatesan 
								of the University of Oklahoma on "Recent Advances in Memristors for Neuromorphic Circuits." From then on, I got 
								interested in this and thought that I could learn about it, explore it, and work in this domain. I read the first-ever 
								paper about memristor that L. Chua published in IEEE. I feel that the memristor is a relatively new concept, with many 
								applications like memristor-based memory design still untapped.
