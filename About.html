								I am Saptashwa Bhattacharjee, a 4th Year undergraduate student in the 
								Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering at the 
								Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur.
								<hr color=#434750>

								I was fascinated by MOSFETs since I was introduced to it in my 2nd year of 
								undergraduate study and decided to dig deeper into it. I started by reading the book 
								<i>"Microelectronics"</i> and then continued exploring the next book in the series: <i>"Design of 
								Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits"</i> series by Behzad Razavi.
								<hr color=#434750>

								In the winter of 2022, I attended the VLSI Winter Workshop by Prof. Mrigank Sharad at IIT Kharagpur. I was
								exposed to analog and mixed signal design techniques and also learnt about various analog building blocks
								such as Op-Amp, TIA, CCO, etc. The outcome of the workshop was a 7-bit frequency counter type ADC, designed in
								LTSpice.
								<hr color=#434750>
								
								Following this, I was inducted in the design of a novel Radiation Hardened Cross-Coupled Quadrature VCO 
								for the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) as an undergraduate research fellow. I was accompanied by
								Adipta Haldar, my batchmate from the Dept. of E&ECE, IIT Kharagpur. We did a full chip tapeout in December 2023.

				I did my summer internship 2024 at the École de technologie supérieure - ÉTS Montréal on Ultra-wideband Wireless 
				Integrated Circuits for Ultra-low Power Communications where I focused on the design of Impulse Radio Ultra-Wideband 
				non-coherent receivers. The frequency range of peration was 3.1GHz to 10.6 GHz.

				Since the beginning of 2024, I have stepped into the field of Circuits for Machine Learning Accelerators. To familiarize 
				myself with the basics, I started with characterization of a current domain and charge domain SRAM cell. Thereafter, I
				proposed a novel current-subtraction based IMC scheme that can accomodate negative weights in the crossbar. I saw the effect
				of process variation and device mismatch on the MAC accuracy for this scheme. <br>
				After finishing my summer internship at ETS Montreal, I continued my venture on ML accelerators. Currently, our team is working
				on a novel Pulse based IMC scheme with a calibration loop that ensures MAC accuracy even in the presence of mismatch and process
				variations. Additonally, I am looking into the binary-weighted capacitive summation of multiple compute-line voltages to reduce
				the number of ADCs in the preipherals, thereby reducing power consumption. The entire work is being done in TSMC 5nm technology node,
				in collaboration with DXCorr Design Inc., USA. 
				<hr color=#434750>

				I am an aspiring PhD candidate with an interest on computationally efficient artificial intelligence through processing-in-memory,
				energy-efficient training and inference, and exploration of beyond-CMOS devices such as FeFET, MTJ, PCM, etc.
